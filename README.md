This is a straightforward social networking application. With it, users can view all registered members, and have the ability to add or remove them from their friend list. In addition, users have the capability to update their status, as well as add and remove posts. This was one of my initial applications built using React in conjunction with TypeScript. For this application, I utilized class components, which provided a solid foundation for understanding and working with React.
